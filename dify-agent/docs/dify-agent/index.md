# Dify Agent runtime

Dify Agent hosts Agenton-composed Pydantic AI runs behind a FastAPI API. Its
source code stays under `src/dify_agent`, while framework-neutral Agenton code
stays under `src/agenton` and `src/agenton_collections`.

See the [operations guide](guide/index.md) for local server behavior.

Workbench executions additionally emit `context_status` events. Their `data.phase`
is `usage`, `compacting`, `compacted`, or `failed`. Token counts describe the current
request context, never cumulative billed usage. `estimated` distinguishes native
pre-request estimates from provider response usage; an unknown model window stays
null. Compaction phases share `compaction_id` and include `before_tokens`.
The existing tiered compactor remains responsible for rewriting history. These
events are non-terminal; consumers that do not display context can ignore them.
